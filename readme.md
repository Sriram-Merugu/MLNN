## Usage
Each implementation is contained within Jupyter notebooks located in the `Implementation` directory. You can run the notebooks to see the algorithms in action.

## Implementations
1. **Back Propagation**: Implements a feedforward neural network using backpropagation for training on the Iris dataset.
2. **Decision Trees**: Implements a decision tree classifier using Gini index and entropy for training on a balance scale dataset.
3. **K-Means Clustering**: Implements K-Means clustering on a synthetic dataset and visualizes the results.
4. **KNN**: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on the Iris dataset and evaluates accuracy for different values of k.
5. **Linear Regression**: Implements linear regression on the Boston housing dataset and visualizes predicted vs actual prices.
6. **Logistic Regression**: Implements logistic regression for binary classification on the breast cancer dataset.
7. **Multi Layer Feedforward Neural Network**: Implements a multi-layer feedforward neural network for cancer detection.
8. **Personalized Cancer Detection**: A comprehensive implementation that combines various techniques for cancer detection, including text processing and model evaluation.

## Study Material
